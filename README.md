What's For Dinner? is an app that I've always wanted to make. There have been so many times that I've looked curiously into the refrigerator, wondering what could come from the items inside.

Project Summary:
You, the user enters ingrediants in the form that are available to you. When submitted, dinner suggestions will be given back to you, along with descriptions of those dinner items.

Approach Taken: 
I really tried to understand what we did in class the past 2 weeks. I wanted to drill the concepts into my head, while learning new things, like Regular Expression and Model.find().

Features:
I created my own API using MONGODB atlas database and Postman with the Node/Express backend. I was able to render my data by using React/JSX. 
I was able to style my app with react-bootstrap.
For a while, I thought I was styling with Bootstrap. but I was not. Next time, I will check which version I have if I am unsure.

Technologies Used:
Express, Mongoose, PostMan, MongoDB, Bootstrap

Future Project Improvements:
I would like to continue working on this app and utilize "react-router-dom". I believe this will make my code more organized and easier to manage, as I had some frustrations with the lack of organization. I think this would also help e access more data from the API.
